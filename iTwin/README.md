# iTwin Plugins

See the iTwin example project provides a sample codec and LoRaWAN device profile. The device profile is provided in JSON and Yaml formats. The yaml format is the preferred format for submitting and documenting your own device profiles to the project and you are encouraged to document settings in the comments.

Please see the [main documentation site](https://connect.docs.test.krucial.cloud/plugins/iTwin/connect-plugins-iTwin.html) for details of how to create suitable LoRaWAN codecs and device profiles for interfacing with the Bentley iTwin system.

The Krucial Connect iTwin plugin requires a combination of custom tag fields and decoded data to be format in a specific format. Note iTwin does not send data to your LoRaWAN devices and any configuration or setup will have to be performed using the Krucial API or CLIs.
